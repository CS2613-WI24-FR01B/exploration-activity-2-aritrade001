## Introduction
This document provides my overall experience with Tkinter library and answers the provided qusetions.

## Questions

### General Questions
<details>
<summary>Which package/library did you select?</summary>
<p>

- I used the Tkinter standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for Python. 

</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the package/library?</summary>
<p>

- Tkinter library provides an object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. I did not have to download as it is included with most Python installations, and it's widely used for creating simple and effective GUI applications due to its ease of use and the availability of comprehensive documentation.
- It is the primary module used to create GUI applications. It must be imported into our Python script to use its functionalities.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What purpose does it serve?</summary>
<p>
  
- Tkinter served the purpose of helping me develop a weather application which can provide user-friendly interface and observe dynamic upadtes.
- I used special labels and frames to configure my data points properly.
- It also helped me to integrate my application wit third party website and handles API requests.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you use it?</summary>
<p>
- First things first, I installed and checked versions.
- In accord to my source code, I used it primarily for the visual represenatation of my weather data.
- I did face some issue while importing and using the libraries but I updated my certificate credentials temporarily
  to make use of the application.
- After creating the main application window (Tk), I added widgets to the application and researched the different type of layout managers.
- My function also handled events and configured the labels properly to reflect the dynamic changes.
- I found the building blocks like including buttons, labels, frames to be easy to use and manage. Each widget in Tkinter is actually a Python class.
- I felt Tkinter acted as a good integration tool in my class to relate my function and effeciently use the API calls.
- I was also able to make personal adjustments to font type and line texture.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the functionalities of the package/library?</summary>
<p>
- Tkinter has great versatility and its functionality could be used to make easy frameworks like to-do lists, get reference, calculator, etc.
- This is the general template:
  import tkinter as tk
  def greet():
      print("Hello World!")
  
  Commented # Create the main window
  root = tk.Tk()
  root.title("Simple code")
  
  Commented # Create a button widget
  greet_button = tk.Button(root, text="Greet", command=greet)
  greet_button.pack()
  
  Commented # Start the Tkinter event loop
  root.mainloop()


 - With good experience one can make a game in Tkinter. Example:

   - References for some good code in Tkinter:

   - This reference is very helpful.

 - Just like my application, we could also make File Explorer: Navigate and manage the filesystem, Chat Application to implement client-server chat interfaces, and Music Players.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>When was it created?</summary>
<p>
  
- Tkinter, as a Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, was introduced with Python version 1.0 in January 1994. Tk itself, which Tkinter wraps, was created by John Ousterhout in 1988.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why did you select this package/library?</summary>
<p>
- I selected this because it helps me as a beginner to explore the libary and it is easy to use. For my application, it required heavy GUI dashboard and this was a 
  good investment on time and energy. There was lot of open source documentation on the internet.
- It has cross-platform use case benefit and lot of videos on Youtube also supported my ideology.
- The standard library is also under python, so it does not make me worry about external installs.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How did learning the package/library influence your learning of the language?</summary>
<p>
- It was compatible with python and helped me practice the core fundamental concepts again like functions, event handling, api reference.
- It helped me appreciate the integrated usage of different python libraries.
- After every change, I ran the module to check my progress and this also helped me catch errors in the python console and debuggging.
- I actually found some of my cases in the open internet and edited my internal structures accordingly. So, it enhance my problem solving 
  skills based on python language.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How was your overall experience with the package/library?</summary>
<p>
- My overall experience with the package/libary was good because I got immediate feedback and support from open source blogs and code in internet. There is lot of coverage.
- I would definitely recommend students who are first time learning to make interesting games and play with the library.
- I would not use this library because there are downsides compared to other GUI Application builders. I felt that there are limited 
  widgets and customization possible due to less in-built structures. I am also well aware that its performance time will sharply reduce 
  with large datasets and that is the reason many application GUIs have premium subsrcription based models to handle dynamic queries in 
  secure way. From the security lens, I faced significant challenge to get my certificate of laptop to handle the interal library calls and 
  I had to temporarily make changes for my system. However, my thoughts are based on the corporate landscape and being a student I feel 
  this a good libary to get started a student.

This project was a result of extensive research over the internet and youtube. I faced significant challenges in the last minute
to manage my certificate credentials in order to access the inner functional html calls. The best solution is to update your configurations internally in the terminal for the certificate. Do NOT edit your code as bypassing the control structures can lead to serious security implications.
