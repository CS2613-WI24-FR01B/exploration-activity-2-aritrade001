## Introduction
This document provides an overview of my Exploration Activity 2 for CS2613. This application is designed to help improve my understanding about the libraries of javascript and get hands-on learning experience from  the organization websites and youtube channels within the project's community. Most calculators use some math library or some external tools, but this application shows the functional implementation of all the calculations in the source code. In line with the scope of my course, my prototype just allows you to go through the general version of the calculator functions and displays results accurately, and in the future we could invest to increase the operational capacity i.e. scientific parameters of interest can be handled.


## Questions

### General Questions
<details>
<summary>Which package/library does the sample program demonstrate?</summary>
<p>

- I used the React library in Javascript for primarily building my user interfaces.
- It provides reusable UI components, which present data that changes over time and utilizes a virtual DOM to improve performance.
- I did not typically "download" React in the traditional sense as I had incorporated it into my project through a package manager called npm.
- I enjoyed the advantages of the libary including, but not limited to component based architecture, declarative UI, and its strong community.

<details>
<summary>Where can I find the source code?</summary>
<p>

- My project's source code is located in the main branch.

### Technical Questions
<details>
<summary>How does someone run your program?</summary>
<p>

- To set up the project locally, please follow the following setup instructions.
  1. Download the source code : node modules, public, and src mainly.
  2. Pre-install the required library : react.
  3. Set the environment and check your PC Settings for terminal to chrome pathways, and wait 4 minutes before usage.
  4. On the terminal, navigate to the directory you saved my source code and run "npm start"
  5. IF IT WORKS, the web browser should open in less than a minute and you could check the accuracy of the calculator by running multiple 
     test cases.

<details>
<summary>What purpose does your program serve?</summary>
<p>

- Calculators like the basic prototype here can serve multiple purposes, catering to different needs ranging from small scale restaurants to specialized requirements for activities such as agriculture business, school's courses, and athletic measurements. Our new friend chatGPT also relies heavily on automated calculators to solve even basic equations.
- It also serves a starting point for business owners to match their financial data sheets at the end of the day.
- Calculation is basic but an important building block to make decisions in  our dy to day life.

<details>
<summary>What would be some sample input/output?</summary>
<p>

- The system requirements for running this project would be to have pre-installed the required libraries (depends on the age and type of PC).
- Next, you could run my application and enter two numbers and verify that the calculator reads them before entering next one.
- Hit the equal to bar after placing the operator of interest between the operands, and you should see this
  if you press "1+2="

This project was a result of extensive research over the internet and youtube. I faced significant challenges in the last minute
to manage my certificate credentials in order to access the inner functional html calls. The best solution is to update your configurations internally in the terminal for the certificate. Do NOT edit your code as bypassing the control structures can lead to serious security implications.
